        In previous weeks we have been learning about arrays and functions and
        they are built-in objects as part of the JavaScript language.
      </p>
      <p class="appear">
        Objects literals are created by the developers and assign values as
        properties of it and functions as methods. Something interesting is that
        a function in an object is also its property and receive the name of
        method like in other programming languages.
      </p>
      <p class="appear">
        Objects are defined in the following way: const anObject = {}
      </p>
      <p class="appear">
        Properties are key-value pairs declared in the following way: age : 36.
        If we have several properties, we separete them by commas like this:
      </p>
      <p class="appear">
        const anObject = {age : 36,<br />
        name: 'Object Literal',<br />
        doSemething(){<br />
        //code for doing something when the method is called <br />
        }<br />
        }
      </p>
      <p class="appear">
        Properties can be accessed by the dot notation or by square bracket
        notation like this: <br />anObject.age <br />
        or <br />
        anObject['age'] <br />
        Square brackets notation are best when properties name are separeted by
        a space, something like anObject['Action performed'];
      </p>
      <p class="appear">
        Properties and methods can be changed or removed, even when they are
        assigned as a const
      </p>
      <p class="appear">
        There are many built-in functions to help us with math operations,
        getting dates and create dates objects.
      </p>
      <p class="appear">
        JSON uses object literal notation to exchange information across
        different plaforms
      </p>
      <p class="appear">
        It is essential to understand about DOM, because it is the organization
        of an HTML document and JavaScript can access the elements of HTML by
        using the document object and its methods to get elements by ID, Classes
        and Selectors and Tags name. Also we have query selectors that can helps
        us change style of the page. For example, I wanted to put in practice
        this in my notes by using querySelectorAll to get the classes that will
        receive an action of a JavaScript Function according to the onclick and
        scroll event listener that I used.
      </p>
      <p class="appear">
        Event listeners can help us te create a more interactive webpage as we
        are able to combine it with DOM manipulation. Event listeners can be
        handled inline on a tag or in a JavaScript file or script tag. Event
        listener works with callbacks functions when an event happens.
      </p>
      <p class="appear">
        Event listener also can be added or removed with addEventListener() and
        removeEventListener().
      </p>
      <h2 class="revealScroll">Questions</h2>
      <p class="revealScroll">
        Is is better to use inline event listeners or just declared in the
        JavaScript file or Script tag?
      </p>
      <p class="revealScroll">
        <strong>Note:</strong> Questions appears by scrolling on the web page
        while notes appears and hide with the buttons
