        Functions are first-class objects, this means they can be passed in the
        same way as every other value. They have their own properties and
        methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Functions can call itself and iterate until a condition is achieved.
        This is called Recursive Functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Callbacks are used to facilitate event-driven Asynchronous programming,
        because JavaScript excecute a code once at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Promises are used to represent the future result of and Asynchronous
        operation. Promises are created with a constructor function in the
        following way:
      </p>
      <p>const promise = new Promise( () )</p>
      <p>
        Async Functions are used with the await keyword. This help to excecute
        when a promise or a condition is met.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ajax is a way to make a webpage dynamic, avoiding to reload the page
        everytime new content need to be rendered. "Ajax" stand for:
        Asynchronous JavaScript and XML. Though XML was the standard used many
        years ago, now Ajax works is most used with json because of it native
        interpretation by JavaScript as an object notation of it. XML require
        extra work to make it render on the page, for that reason developers
        prefers to used json instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, XMLHttpRequest object was widely used to work with Ajax, but
        now is better used the living standard of Fetch API
      </p>
      <p>We can use fetch() in the following way:</p>
      <p>
        fetch('https://somelink.com/here')<br />
        .then(//Something happens here)<br />
        .catch(//Here will handle the errors)
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's and example from the readings: "Number Fact" that has a response
        as a Text and a "Chuck Norris Fact" that receives a JSON response and it
        parsed into this html
      </p>
      <p>
        Something important here (as a personal disclaimer) is to note this
        warning from the reading:
      </p>
      <quote
        >"Some of the “facts” returned by chucknorris.io can be mildly offensive
        and use inappropriate language, so proceed with caution!"</quote
      ><br />
      <button id="number">Number Fact</button>
      <button id="chuck">Chuck Norris Fact</button>
      <div id="output">Ajax response will appear here</div>
      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>
        I've seen projects using XMLHttpRequest and other useing Fetch with
        AJAX. When is better to use one of this methods instead of the other?
