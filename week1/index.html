        <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>
            From the readings of "Doing Stuff with web things", Section 2.3 and I was wondering and comparing about using localstorage instead of sessions and cookies. Localstorage is more likely to work in the development of a local aplication instead a one running on the cloud or a hosting server. I think that having localstorage as an option to have an aplication online but using personal data in your computer, without dealing with uploading your files into the cloud or another service to be processed. But, Cloud computing have more advantages.
        </p>
        <p>Watching the tutorial from SitePoint, "Master Mobile UX", I learned about having in mind all the ways the user will interact with our site or web app. I realize about changing our mind to make possible to work with "mobile first" aproach and avoid just using "Responsive Retrofittng", which is good for existing sites, but not to those being in process of being created.</p>
        <p>Also, from the videos, I learned that we need to consider how many steps a user needs to achieve something, so we need to customize it so the user enjoy the expirience of being in our page instead of leaving it because to much steps to achieve something. These apply when we want to add some ads in our site and look for a way to diminish the use of pop ups and make a better use of the proportions of the screen with ads.</p>
        <h2>Questions</h2>
        <p>SEO and UX can be studied as an advanced level of Web Programming?</p>
        <p>How can I better implement ads in a site?</p>
        <p>Do I really need localstorage when Cloud Computing is having a lot of demand this days?</p>
