      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>
        Testing and debugging it is essential as a developer, because we want to
        create a good User Experience. We need to be aware of three kind of
        possible errors:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>System Error</li>
        <li>Programmer Error</li>
        <li>User Error</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There's no to much we can do with system errors, but we can fix and
        control programmer and users errors. We have to predict as much as
        possible the possible user error to create a good experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        We need to deal with Errors, Exceptions, Stack traces and Warnings.
        Being aware of these things will help us to avoid our program to run
        incorrectly.
      </p>
      <p>
        JavaScript fail silently and that will need of our attention to fix any
        problem may appear while we are in the production of the solution and
        avoid that errors may affect the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this reason, ECMAScript 5 introduced Strict Mode. Strict Mode will
        throw an exception instead of warnings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Linting Tools have been created to test the quality of our code. JS
        Lint, JS Hint and ES Lint are one of those linting tools we can use
        these days. But, this is not a guarantee that our code does not have
        errors, but decrease it the erros and depends on us.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the other hand, we can't rely that the user will always have the
        latest version of a browser, so we need to check or detect if a feature
        is supported before excecuting our code, or give an alternative way to
        execute it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can test using console.log and in some situation the altert() method
        to know how our code is giving or taking some values. But, after using
        it, we need to delete to avoid bad excecution of our code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jest is a Test-Driven Development framework, created by facebook to
        create and run tests.

      <p>Is there another TDD framework other than Jest?</p>
