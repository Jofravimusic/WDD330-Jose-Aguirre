      <h2>Notes</h2>
      <p>
        As JavaScript can be run on different enviroments, when we run it on the
        Browser, our Global Object is the window.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Browser Object Model (BOM) helps us understand how this works. In
        this example it is used the open and close method from the windows
        Object of the browser:
      </p>
      <button type="button" onclick="PopUp.open()" id="openButton">
        New window to main
      </button>
      <button type="button" onclick="PopUp.close()" id="closeButton" disabled>
        Close window to main
      </button>
      <p>
        Dialogs are others methods from the windows object. window.alert(),
        window.prompt() and window.confirm() . In previous notes I used it to
        excecute some codes. Refer to them.
      </p>

      In the following example, I used the timing functions setInteval() and
      clearInterval() to create an animation. Nowadays, it is used
      requestAnimationFrame() methods, but it is recommended to use @keyframes
      on CSS for better performance.
      <div id="square"></div>

      <button type="button" onclick="window.clearInterval(rotateSquare)">
        Stop Rotate
      </button>
      <p>
        document object is part of the window object on the browser. We can
        manage cookies on the document object in the following way:
      </p>
      <p>document.cookie = 'nameCourse=WDD330'</p>

      <p>
        We can get the cookies of a website by going to the console and writting
        document.cookie and it will display them all.
      </p>
      <p>Here I posted some examples of HTML5 API:</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Websockets</strong>: using this service:
        wss://ws.postman-echo.com/raw
      </p>
      <form>
        <label for="message">Enter a Message:</label>
        <input type="text" name="message" />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
      <div id="output"></div>
      <p><strong>Notifications</strong></p>
      <p>
        In this examples, the first button ask for permission to receive
        notifications. The second button ask for permission if is not asked
        before and then displayed a message with an event listener (which is the
        click event) and then open a new window with the main menu of this
        portfolio
      </p>
      <button type="button" onclick="askNotification()">
        Ask for permission for Notification
      </button>
      <button type="button" onclick="sendNotification()">
        Receive a Notification
      </button>
      <p>
        Multimedia API was used in this week team assigment. The multimedia was
        audio.
      </p>
      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>
        In the readings recommend the use of keyframes on css instead of
        javaScript animations. When do we need to use one instead of the other?
      </p>

        Examples in this notes were taken from the book and then adapted by me.
