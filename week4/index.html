        Forms are the main componets on the web that allows the user interact
        with the webpage. Many search engines like google, yahoo and others use
        forms as parts of their DOM, specially input tags and buttons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's a litlle example of a form with some JavaScript code that help
        the user interact with the web. (This example was part of the lecture of
        the book).
      </p>
      <form name="search" action="/search">
        <input name="searchInput" />
        <button type="submit">Search</button>
      </form>
      <p>
        There's different elements to work with in the forms. We have the input
        tags of type text (default), password, check boxes, radio buttons and
        file uploads; also, we have textarea for large input of text and select
        as a list of options.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to use JavaScript to do Form validation, so, the
        information entered by the user can be filter and processed before being
        sent to the server. Inside the input tag we can use validation keywords
        like: required, min, max. Here's a simulation of a login form with some
        of this properties (try it, it will display a message):
      </p>
      <form action="/something" name="login" class="login-form">
        <input type="email" required placeholder="Email is required" />
        <input type="password" required placeholder="Password is required" />
        <button type="submit">Login</button>
      </form>

        Object-Oriented Programming is a style of programming. Many languages
        creates classes and then creates objects using those classes as
        instances of a Class. In JavaScript this was done exactly the same we
        learn last week when creating Objects Literal before ES6, because
        classes have properties and methods and objects in JavaScript are
        similiar to it. Then in ES6 was introduced the new class declaration.
        This is an example:
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0 auto; max-width: 22em">
        class Animal{<br />
        &emsp;constructor(name, family){<br />
        &emsp;&emsp;this.name = name;<br />
        &emsp;&emsp;this.family = family <br />
        &emsp;} <br />
        &emsp;run(){<br />
        &emsp;&emsp;return `${this.name} is running`; <br />
        &emsp;showFamily() {<br />
        &emsp; return `${this.name}'s family is ${this.family}`; <br />
        &emsp; } <br />
        &emsp;} <br />
        }
      </p>
      <p>Creating an instance of a class is like this:</p>
      <p>const cat = new Animal('cat', 'feline');</p>
      <button type="button" onclick="cat.run()">Example Cat method run</button>
      <button type="button" onclick="cat.showFamily()">Cat's family</button>
      <p>
        By default, properties and methods on JavaScript are public, but we can
        use getter and setter like in other programming languages. We achieve
        this by writting properties with and underscore before the name. Example
        with the previous Animal Class:
      </p>
      class Animal{<br />
      &emsp;constructor(name){<br />
      &emsp;&emsp;let _name = name;<br />
      &emsp;} <br />
      &emsp;this.setName = name => { return _name = name; }<br />
      &emsp;} <br />
      &emsp;this.getName = () => _name; <br />
      }
      <p>
        In OOP there are three main concepts: Encapsulation, Polymorphism and
        Inheritance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developing in JavaScript in these days has a lot of tools to help us
        scale our production. In this days we have libraries like jQuery,
        Underscore & Lodash and React.js that can manipulate DOM; frameworks,
        package managers like npm in Node.js
      </p>
      <p>
        We can devide our code by using modular JavaScript. This is done by
        creating different pieces of .js files and then importing in the mains
        .js files being used
      </p>
      <p>
        Node.js introduced npm. With npm we can install thousands of packages
        with api, libraries and others tools that can help us with our
        programming tasks. When using npm init, this create a package.json file
        with the packages installed for our project.
      </p>
      <p>Yarn in an alternative option to npm.</p>
      <h2>Questions</h2>
      <p>
        Objects and classes looks like the same in JavaScript. When is better to
        use a Class instead of an Object and vice versa?
